# school
These are programming exercises from school that I would like to show off.

# How do I know what a program does?
I add a `info.md` file to all folders/projects to explain what it does.

# So, why?
I made it so I can keep a little backup of old projects from school, for future reference, and to show other people what you can learn at school.
For now, I already knew everything we did in class (all the python stuff).
