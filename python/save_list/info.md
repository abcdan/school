# Save List
This was an example test we had to make, to prepare us for the real test.
I personally completed this one in around 30 minutes, all we got was a description on what the program needed to do.

# Expected output
The output depends on your input, example with input number 10.
(OUT:, IN and OUT+IN: were added later for this info file)
```
OUT:    This program asks to enter some sentences, until you just press [enter].
        When you are done with the input, the program with print all the lines.
        After that, it will ask you if you would like to save it to a file.

OUT+IN: Enter a sentence: How are you?
OUT+IN: Enter a sentence: Test!
OUT+IN: Enter a sentence:
OUT:    How are you?
OUT:    Test!
OUT+IN: Would you like to save the list to a file (y/n) y
OUT+IN: Enter the name of the file, example, list.txt: file.txt
OUT+IN: Would you like to make another list? (y/n): n
```

You can view the output file in this repo, it's called `file.txt`

# How to run
Simply do `py app.py` if you are in the folder.
